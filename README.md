# Sign-Up Form, this shit took me like 4 hours to make :(

<p align = "center">
<img src = "./images/meta.jpeg" width = "450px" height = "575px">
</p>


There are 6 input fields, all of which are mandatory to fill.

Also, I added some JS to check whether "password" and "check-password" contain the same string or not
